1. Practise with your hands **separate** at first!
2. Practise with a **metronome** – play it well at a slow bpm before increasing it to get closer to performance-tempo!
3. Don't fall into the **trap** of practising things **you already know** rather than things you don’t know

    * Don't go back to the start of the piece if you're having trouble. Instead, **keep practising** that bar and section.
	* Cleaning up a passage is “new”, playing parts because they’re easy isn’t.

4. **Warm up** your hands before getting into harder pieces! The last thing you want to happen is to **injure** your hands. Warming up can be anything from simply playing scales to playing an ‘easier’ piece.

## Motivation/Personal

> “No, seriously, I was the worst in my class” <br> **— Animenz**

1. **Compare yourself to your past self** and not to the prodigies in the community. After all, if you beat your past self and made improvements, what more can you ask for?
2. **Try and remember things in groups**, like chords or a theme or a picture in your head, rather than individual notes
3. **Have fun** whilst doing it! but also keep in mind practice **can be a bit mundane so push through!**
4. Take **inspiration** from great **records/performances**
5. **Set** small **attainable** goals for each practice session!

```admonish example
“I’ll learn bars X - Y for this session.”
```

6. Don’t set out to learn a piece way beyond your reach, be realistic with your current ability!

	* Pieces that are **slightly above** your skill level will help you improve, but anything more than that might actually hinder improvement and waste valuable time.
	* You can use [pianosyllabus.com](https://pianosyllabus.com) to find the grade level for different classical pieces across numerous examination boards
	
7. **Ask** for help from people who are better or have played the piece before!
8. There is no need to **only** practice! Make sure to take **breaks** during long practice sections!

	* You don’t want to cause an injury by practising too much >_<
	
9. If possible, learn the piece with a friend! This means that both of you can **motivate** each other to **achieve** your personal best!
