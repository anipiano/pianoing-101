<li>
<p>Practise with a <strong>metronome</strong> – play it well at a slow bpm before increasing it to get closer to performance-tempo!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't fall into the <strong>trap</strong> of practising things <strong>you already know</strong> rather than things you don’t know</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't go back to the start of the piece if you're having trouble. Instead, <strong>keep practising</strong> that bar and section.</li>
<li>Cleaning up a passage is “new”, playing parts because they’re easy isn’t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Warm up</strong> your hands before getting into harder pieces! The last thing you want to happen is to <strong>injure</strong> your hands. Warming up can be anything from simply playing scales to playing an ‘easier’ piece.</p>

<p><strong>Compare yourself to your past self</strong> and not to the prodigies in this server. After all, if you beat your past self and made improvements, what more can you ask for?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Try and remember things in groups</strong>, like chords or a theme or a picture in your head, rather than individual notes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Have fun</strong> whilst doing it! but also keep in mind practice <strong>can be a bit mundane so push through!</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take <strong>inspiration</strong> from great <strong>records/performances</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set</strong> small <strong>attainable</strong> goals for each practice session! E.g. “I’ll learn bars X - Y for this session.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t set out to learn a piece way beyond your reach, be realistic with your current ability!</p>
<ul>
<li>Pieces that are <strong>slightly above</strong> your skill level will help you improve, but anything more than that might actually hinder improvement and waste valuable time.</li>
<li>You can use <a href="https://pianosyllabus.com">pianosyllabus.com</a> to find the grade level for different classical pieces across numerous examination boards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask</strong> for help from people who are better or have played the piece before!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no need to <strong>only</strong> practice! Make sure to take <strong>breaks</strong> during long practice sections!</p>
<ul>
<li>You don’t want to cause an injury by practising too much &gt;_&lt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If possible, learn the piece with a friend! This means that both of you can <strong>motivate</strong> each other to <strong>achieve</strong> your personal best!</p>

</blockquote>
<p><em>Here we’re talking about general techniques, there’s a specific technique section after this!</em></p>
<ol>
<li>In general, keep your fingers <strong>curved</strong> when playing. </li>
<li>Practise hands <strong>separately</strong> before putting them together.</li>
<li>Find the <strong>best fingerings</strong> when you're practising slowly, don't practice random fingerings only to find that they don't work for playing faster → experiment with what works best or just ask!</li>
<li>Focus on bringing out the <strong>melody</strong>, so maybe just playing the melody instead of all the other notes can be helpful!</li>
<li>Make sure to have <strong>good posture</strong> and <strong>relax</strong> your entire body (e.g. hands and shoulders)</li>
<li>Have <strong>space</strong> between your elbows and body; it’ll give you more freedom to play!</li>
<li>Use <strong>arm weight!</strong> Don’t limit your playing to only your fingers.</li>
<li>Try sitting in a <strong>higher seat position</strong>, most pianists’ elbows are around parallel with the piano keys → this will allow you to put more weight into the keyboard!</li>
<li><strong>Do not implement pedalling</strong> until you are confident that you can play the notes correctly! Playing with a pedal can make it harder to hear if you’re making a nice sound on individual notes.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="scales"><a class="header" href="#scales">Scales</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Piano teachers: &quot;So, have you practised your scales?&quot; <br>Student: Disapparates <br>       <strong>— LIN</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Incredibly important for building <strong>finger dexterity</strong>.</li>
<li>Practising scales are a great way to learn how to <strong>lift</strong> your fingers and to <strong>modify</strong> wrist position while making turns.</li>
<li>Scales are useful for <del>Vene</del> runs </li>
<li>With scales, try, practicing tucking your thumb under your hand to cross over to the next note that is played with your thumb</li>
<li>Amazing way to warm up your fingers/hands, which is important to play better as well as not sustain any injuries</li>
<li>Don’t accent notes with the thumb</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-admonish tip">Try playing scales at the beginning of your practice session and aim for clarity. Also try going up (crescendo) and then back down (decrescendo) in volume as you go up and down the keyboard with a scale.

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Advice from the Piano VI The Great, “Pedal before it gets muddy,” it’s actually very simple advice when it comes to overpedalling</li>

<p>How to play Arpeggios: Don’t <br> <strong>— Piano VI</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make sure you know the arpeggio scale: e.g. for F-major arpeggio, it would be F, A, C, F. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wrist position</strong> is very important:</p>
<ul>
<li>On descending Right hand: having a high wrist is very helpful </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure your hands are <strong>ascending/descending along with</strong> the notes. Having them stay in the same position will make it harder for you to reach the notes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try practising the arpeggios with different rhythms like making the first note of the pattern slow while the rest are quick. Switch them up, and visit the original rhythm from time to time until you can play it. This can help you familiarize the movement and position of your hand on every note</p>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Make sure to pay attention to phrasing, “rising up and going back down” - this can often be seen with slurs as it <strong>“rises”</strong> and <strong>“falls”</strong></li>
<li><strong>Raising</strong> your <strong>wrist</strong> can be a great way to make a note more <strong>quiet</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dropping</strong> your <strong>wrist</strong> on a chord or note can be a great way to <strong>bring it out!</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sing</strong> the melody of the song! Often times, the shape of your voice on the melody should be the same shape of the melody when you play on the piano</li>
<li>Pay attention to the room you’re playing in, and try to use the <strong>acoustics</strong> of the room to your full <strong>advantage</strong></li>
<li>If you’re not sure about interpretation, try and <strong>look at</strong> how other pianists have played and interpreted it.</li>

<p>&quot;vene runs are great&quot; <br>       <strong>— null_awe</strong> <br> Watch them on <a href="https://youtu.be/oGt5KVv24Ag?t=1212">Animenz Piano Concerto | Happy Birthday! ft. 69 Pianists</a> (timestamped!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Steps to play <del>Vene runs:</del></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Look for any <strong>patterns</strong> (scales, arpeggios, etc.) in the runs and mark them out. This will help simplify the run for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now look at the remaining sections and write out <strong>fingerings</strong> for them; this one is very important. For any run passage, if you don't use efficient fingerings, this will lead to wrong notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practise each section of the run slowly, move your hand in the direction of the run, and use your elbow and maybe even the whole arm to direct your hand. This makes it easier to play the run quickly. </p>
<ul>
<li>accent key notes such as those on the first beat/signifying the start of the pattern </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now memorise each section, play it a few times with your eyes open, and then play it a few times with eyes closed. If something is wrong, identify the error and check: is it because of fingering or any other problem?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you have memorised the run, add the accompanying hand and memorise that as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now play the run with both hands, slowly with a metronome. If anything goes wrong here, look back again: is it fingering? Usually, when runs go wrong, it's about inefficient fingering. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you have played the run and gotten it up to a decent speed, memorise it! Memorising is key since it's inefficient to play while staring at the notes, especially with passages like runs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Do the steps above and the run will end up really easy to play.</p>
<p>(Don't play any run with the pedal until you have fully learnt it, the pedal will prevent you from knowing the &quot;original&quot; sound of the run.)</p>
<h3 id="extra-practice-tips-for-runs"><a class="header" href="#extra-practice-tips-for-runs">Extra practice tips for runs</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Play the run in staccato - this helps you to articulate the notes.</li>
<li>Play the run with over-exaggerated finger lifting and articulation - helps you articulate the notes and build strength.</li>
<li>If the runs are at a constant note value (e.g., quaver), you can play the run in a dotted-quaver followed by a semiquaver rhythmic fashion. Then afterwards, you reverse it, so it comes a semiquaver followed by a dotted-quaver rhythmic pattern.</li>
<li>Play with run with “false staccatos”,  where you do a firm staccato without collapsing your fingers, but your fingers still remain on the keys after the “bounce” of the staccato)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trilling"><a class="header" href="#trilling">Trilling</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Trilling is a controlled hand seizure&quot; <br>       <strong>— Prancen</strong> <br> Note: if it's <em><strong>uncontrolled</strong></em>, please see Doctor Yahya for a prescription of Carbamazepine</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Loosen your fingers when trilling - tense fingers will cause you to play the notes slower.</li>
<li>When trilling between two notes, the best fingering to use in general is 2 and 3. However, this may change depending on your preference and if you have to play other notes whilst trilling!</li>
<li>When trilling for long periods of time, it is recommended to alternate which fingers you use. e.g. switching between 1&amp;2 for one note and 3 for the other.</li>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>First, identify the voices (ex: bass, melody, etc.) and which hand is playing which.</li>
<li>Practise in <strong>sections</strong>, and practise each voice separately just to get an idea of the role of each hand.</li>
<li>Try to play both hands together <strong>slowly</strong> first to get the “feel” of how each hand works in doing the 3 hand technique in that section. 4.Emphasising the main melody can also help you get that “feel” as you can understand how the other voices support the melody.</li>
<li>Once you understand the movement of your hands, it may be easier to practise the hands separately to develop independence and to polish.</li>
<li>Continue practising at a slow tempo and gradually increase it until you finally master it at the desired tempo.</li>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be wary</strong> of <strong>how tense your hand/wrist</strong> is when practising/doing jumps. Don’t keep it too tense as it may cause an injury. </li>
<li>When first learning jumps, practise them by <strong>‘shadow jumping’</strong> - that is, do your jumps without physically pressing into the keys. This is to get you familiarised with the positions of your notes.</li>
<li>When you have built the confidence, practise pressing into the keys and jumping at a slow tempo. This is to further familiarise your hands with the notes you are playing. </li>
<li>Gradually raise the tempo for the third step until you can play the desired BPM!</li>
<li>If both hands are doing jumps at the same time, focus and master one hand before doing the other.</li>
<li>When you have mastered both hands separately, practise slowly together in small phrases.</li>
<li>Slowly raise the tempo again!</li>
<li>Keep practising until you can play the section masterfully.</li>

<pre><code class="language-admonish tip &quot;Bonus tip!&quot;">You can attempt to practice your jumps with your eyes closed if you want to memorise the section faster. Again, start off slow and speed it up gradually, making sure you’re hitting every note correctly!

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When playing an octave, remember that the <strong>distance</strong> is always the same, be it on black keys or white keys. Once you set your fingers for the distance of an octave, they will almost always hit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While playing an octave with your 1st and 5th finger is the norm, the thumb and ring finger combo is also possible and in some cases more comfortable. Generally, black keys are played with your ring (4th) finger and white with your pinky (5th).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t be intimidated by passages such as:</p>

 </center>
 <br>
<ul>
<li>Loosen up your wrists, but keep your fingers at the same distance. A technique to reduce fatigue would be to alternate your 4th and 5th finger between each octave spam, similar to how you alternate your fingers during a long trill.</li>

<ol>
<li>Aim to play the notes all at the same time. To do this, keep your fingers at a fixed position and let your wrist/arm be the one to press down on the keys rather than lifting and moving the fingers.</li>
<li>To emphasise certain notes of a chord, the fingers of the notes you want emphasised should be lower than the rest. That way, when you press down, the lowered fingers will produce a louder sound, placing emphasis on the notes.</li>
<li>To arpeggiate a chord, tilt your wrist such that when you drop your hands to hit the keys, it’ll naturally hit the keys in a certain order, be it ascending or descending.</li>

<h3 id="myehs-gliss"><a class="header" href="#myehs-gliss">Myehs' gliss</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>One thing to keep in mind: when glissing, what you’re trying to do is to keep the same position while sliding your finger from point A to point B. The less friction you have with the keys, the better and less painful.</li>
<li>When glissing down, I usually gliss with the 1st finger, like the position of the hand as shown in picture.</li>
<li>When glissing up, the 2nd - 4th finger is what I usually go to. The idea is that your thumb is as resilient in maintaining the gliss as 2-3 of your other fingers. However, in some cases, I would actually use my 4th and 5th finger to gliss.</li>
<li><strong>READ:</strong> gliss with any finger you like, this is just an example.</li>
